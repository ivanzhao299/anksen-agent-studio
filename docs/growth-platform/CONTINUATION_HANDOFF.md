# ANKSEN AI Growth Platform — Continuation Handoff

Updated: 2026-08-26
Status: ACTIVE
Branch: `feature/anksen-ai-growth-platform`
Draft PR: `#35`
Program Issue: `#34`

## Product and architecture boundary

ANKSEN AI Growth Platform is a reusable, multi-tenant product on the existing Studio control plane. KingTurf is the first pilot tenant, not the Core boundary. Reuse the existing Kernel, Planner, Scheduler, Worker, Runtime, Approval, Audit, RBAC, credential-reference and activation gates; never create a second orchestration stack.

All authoritative records and events require `organizationId + workspaceId + tenantId`. External writes require declared capability, idempotency, audit and policy approval where applicable. CRM/ERP/RFQ/quote/order systems remain authoritative downstream. Do not push, merge, deploy, migrate production data or enable a real Runtime without explicit authorization.

## Implemented and verified baseline

The executable path covers GA-000~017:

`Discovery -> Identity Resolution -> Lead -> Explainable Score -> Engagement -> Next Best Action -> Opportunity -> Downstream Handoff -> Revenue Attribution -> Executive Report`

The current branch also includes a durable PostgreSQL schema/store, atomic tenant-scoped identity resolution, Customer 360 persistence smoke, KingTurf and unrelated-tenant packs, governed publishing, and a signed website conversion webhook connector. These are implementation and acceptance slices, not production authorization.

Run the synchronized local gate before continuing:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm growth-platform:acceptance
```

The gate runs Core unit and GA acceptance tests, production-connector tests, PostgreSQL store unit tests, and an isolated PostgreSQL persistence smoke.

## Direct continuation priority

1. Keep the unified local/CI gate green and close persistence/interface inconsistencies first.
2. Continue GA-004~007 persistent discovery, Lead Graph, score history and Customer 360 evidence.
3. Harden GA-008~017 connector reconciliation, bounded retry, approval/failure paths, UI and operational evidence.
4. Validate KingTurf through governed connectors and downstream mappings.
5. Validate a second non-KingTurf tenant without a Core or schema fork.

Read `ANKSEN_AI_GROWTH_PLATFORM_PLAN.md`, `CLOSED_LOOP_ACCEPTANCE.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_QUEUE.md`, and `packages/growth-core/README.md`, inspect the first failing or unproven acceptance criterion, and continue from there without restarting product discovery.
